It is being used to analyze large datasets, predict disease outbreaks, develop personalized treatment plans, and assist in surgeries. AI algorithms can sift through medical records, lab results, and research articles to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent to human physicians. AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are being used to provide personalized health advice and support to patients, reducing the burden on healthcare providers and improving patient satisfaction. AI is also being used to develop predictive models for disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, to help public health officials and policymakers make informed decisions about resource allocation and containment strategies.
