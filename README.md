# Text-Summarization
Abstractive and Extractive Text summarization Transformer model built using a Flask web app containing use cases of pretrained models of T5, Pegasus,  BART and LED Transformers for Abstractive Text Summarization and TF-IDF and Page Rank algorithm for extractive summarization.
In the web-app, you can see the option to run the summarizer using any of the above mentioned algorithms, also you can view the comparitive performance of these models.
