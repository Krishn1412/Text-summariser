# Text-summariser
Create  front end code for this program. This front end will contain a form which will accept the text which needs to be summarized.
Below that will be two buttons, one which says extractive based and other which says abstractive based. Clicking on any one will result in summary being generated in that particular way.
LSTM based deep learning models for abstractive and simple tf-idf algorithm for extractive.
